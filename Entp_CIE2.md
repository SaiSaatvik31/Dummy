## 25. Explain Urgency time management matrix?

The Urgency Time Management Matrix (Eisenhower Matrix) categorizes activities based on their **Importance** and **Urgency** into four quadrants to help prioritize focus.

## 26. Explain Project planning CPM techniques.

The **Critical Path Method (CPM)** is a deterministic project planning technique used when activity times are known and fixed. The steps involved are:

1. Identify activities and sequence them.
2. Draw a network diagram.
3. Estimate time for each activity.
4. Find earliest start and finish times.
5. Identify the **critical path**, which is the longest duration path through the network.
6. Determine project duration and control delays by focusing on critical activities .
CPM is useful in construction and manufacturing as it highlights slack/float time and helps in resource allocation.

## 27. Explain PERT Techniques in detail.

The **Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)** is a probabilistic technique used when activity times are uncertain. It uses three time estimates for each task:

1. 
**Optimistic time (O):** The best-case scenario.


2. 
**Most likely time (M):** The normal duration.


3. 
**Pessimistic time (P):** The worst-case scenario.



The Expected Time () is calculated using the formula:


.
PERT is suitable for R&D and new product development as it helps in risk analysis and forecasting completion time where standard times are not available.

Key attributes for an effective personality include **Attitude** (optimistic/positive), **Enthusiasm** (intense interest), **Ethical** (moral principles), **Goal Focused** (clarity on objectives), **Listener** (empathetic), **Persistent** (enduring adversity), and **Self-Confidence** (belief in abilities) .

**Personality Models:**

1. **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI):** Based on Jung’s theories, it uses four dichotomies: Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. These combine to form 16 personality types (e.g., ISTJ, ENFP) useful for career and relationship counseling.


2. 
**The Big Five Model:** Identifies five basic dimensions: **Extroversion** (sociable), **Emotional Stability** (calm vs. nervous), **Agreeableness** (cooperative), **Conscientiousness** (dependable/organized), and **Openness** (creative/curious) .


3. 
**Physiognomy:** Sheldon’s model based on body types: Endomorph (friendly/comfort-seeking), Mesomorph (aggressive/active), and Ectomorph (shy/intelligent) .

* **Types of Motivation:**
* 
**Negative:** Based on fear or force (threats of demotion).


* 
**Positive:** Based on reward and possibility of gain.


* 
**Extrinsic:** External benefits like wages, insurance, and holidays.

## 32. Explain in a detail about project organization.

Project organization refers to the structure and roles required to execute a project effectively.
**Types:**

1. **Functional Organization:** Based on departments (finance, marketing). It offers specialization but may have slow decision-making.


2. **Project (Pure) Organization:** The team works only for the project. It offers fast decisions and strong control but can be costly due to resource duplication.


3. **Matrix Organization:** A combination where members have dual reporting to functional and project managers. It offers flexibility but can cause conflict due to dual authority.



**Key Roles:** The structure includes the Project Manager (oversees lifecycle), Project Sponsor (funding/direction), Team Members (execution), and Stakeholders.

## 34. Describe in detail about project planning and control using CPM and PERT techniques.

**Critical Path Method (CPM):**
CPM is a deterministic technique used when activity times are known and fixed. It involves identifying activities, drawing a network diagram, and calculating the critical path (longest duration path). It focuses on time-cost trade-offs and is widely used in construction and manufacturing. It helps identify "slack" or float time in non-critical tasks.

**Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT):**
PERT is a probabilistic technique used when activity durations are uncertain. It uses three time estimates (Optimistic, Most Likely, Pessimistic) to calculate an Expected Time (). It focuses on uncertainty and risk assessment, making it suitable for R&D projects.

**Comparison:**

* **Time Estimate:** CPM is Fixed/Single-point; PERT is Probabilistic/Three-point.


* **Focus:** CPM focuses on Time & Cost; PERT focuses on Time and Risk.


* **Use Area:** CPM for Construction; PERT for Research & Development.



Both methods are used to plan realistic timelines, schedule tasks (Gantt charts), monitor progress against milestones, and manage risks.
